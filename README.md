# Automated Car Using Neural Network and NEAT

This is the code for a self driving Neural Network using NEAT in Python

To execute it, run main.py in python 3.7.
You also need NEAT, pygame, numpy and scipy

- Tweak Settings : `config_variables.py` and `config_file.txt` 

```requires-python = ">=3.13"
dependencies = [
    "neat-python>=1.1.0",
    "numpy>=2.4.1",
    "pygame>=2.6.1",
    "scipy>=1.17.0",
]```
